// Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function solves a problem by calling itself with a simpler version of the input. This process relies on two critical elements: a base case, which is the condition that stops the recursion, and a recursive step, where the function calls itself to move closer to that base case. The computer manages this chain of calls using the call stack, which works on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. During the "winding" phase, each time the function calls itself, a new task is pushed onto the stack, pausing the previous one. It is this relentless winding of the stack that is responsible for a stack overflow error; if a base case is missing or can never be reached, the function will call itself endlessly until it exhausts the stack's finite memory. Once a valid base case is hit, however, the "unwinding" phase begins. The most recent function call resolves, returns its result to its caller, and is popped off the stack. This continues in reverse order until the original call is resolved, effectively breaking down a large problem into a series of smaller, manageable steps.


// Any problem that can be solved with iteration can be solved with recursion, and any problem that can be solved with recursion can also be solved with iteration.
